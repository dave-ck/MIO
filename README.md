# Install
Open in Android Studio and build the .apk or download from this link (usually update at the same time as this repository): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f7QqyEGvT4Q1xrsG4yQtSzLFBmhxsg8L/view?usp=sharing).
Enable the MIO keyboard as a custom keyboard. 
Open the MIO app - the letters M, I, O should vibrate upon doing this.
Tap the "Exercise" activity. The normal system keyboard should open - in the bottom right corner of the screen, switch the keyboard to the MIO keypad. You will need to change back to the normal keyboard later!
